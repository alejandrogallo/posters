# Ab-initio simulations of vacancy-impurity complexes in carbon allotropes

Nitrogen Vacancy defects in diamond have become over the last years an
important candidate  for a  bulk room temperature  quantum information
processing device.  In this poster  we investigate the  feasibility of
approximate  density  functional  theory calculations  for  describing
optical  and   electronic  properties  for   several  vacancy-impurity
complexes in different carbon allotropes.
