# CC4S: Massively parallel coupled cluster theory algorithms for material science

  A promising class of approximations widely used in quantum chemistry
  to solve the many-electron Schr√∂dinger equation is the so-called
  coupled-cluster (CC) family of methods.
  These methods achieve for a large
  class of molecular systems a high accuracy at a comparably moderate
  cost.  Here, we report results of state-of-the-art simulations
  employing high performance computing resources to produce reliable
  benchmark results of molecules, surfaces and periodic solids
  containing more than 50 atoms.  In this context, we present recent
  advances implemented in our newly released code Coupled Cluster for
  Solids (cc4s), where we apply CC methods to solid state systems
  employing a plane-wave basis-set together with novel basis-set and
  finite-size correction schemes. To this end, we employ and contribute to
  the massively-parallel Cyclops Tensor contraction Framework and
  develop the high-performance CCSD(T) library Atrip.
