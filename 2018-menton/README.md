# Equation of motion coupled cluster theory using periodic boundary conditions

We present recent progress in the implementation of an equation of motion
coupled cluster theory method using periodic boundary conditions and a plane
wave basis set.  We seek to study electronic ground and excited states in
Nitrogen Vacancy centers in diamond which have become a promising candidate for
a bulk room temperature quantum information processing device. Technical details
of the implementation and preliminary results will be presented.
